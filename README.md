# particle-v2v (English)
Prototype for the hackster-particle contest.

This repository store the code use in the particle contest held at http://hackster.io. I am joining the contest with a prototype of comunication 
between vehicles using the particle cloud system. The main idea is to sense the environment and publish event to the area, so the nearby vehicles 
can react knowing what is going on around them.

I have also a detailed explanation in spanish: http://www.laboratoriogluon.com/mi-proyecto-v2v-para-el-concurso-de-particle-en-hackster/
